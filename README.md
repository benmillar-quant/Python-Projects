This is repository containing my data analysis python scripts used for back-testing a chart indicator trading strategies across many different markets and timeframes using historial market OHLC data. 
There are 3 main strategies, each with a seperate buy and sell scripts for each strategy, making a total of 6 projects.
These strategies are Kelter Channel, RSI and Moving Averages.
This repository also contains the scripts i use to extract market OHLC data from a broker/data provider via API's and scripts used to clean the data by removing times/intervals that are not relevant and also consolidating data so that it converts into any time desired. e.g converting 1 minute chart data into 3 minute chart data.
